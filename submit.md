## About Our Seminars

The Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminars provide a platform for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to present computational genomics research. Seminar talks can address any biological question but should feature a computational approach. Talks on novel bioinformatics tools or methods are also welcome.

Seminars are held over Zoom on Fridays at 11 AM ET / 10 AM CT. See the [seminar schedule](seminars.html) for upcoming dates.

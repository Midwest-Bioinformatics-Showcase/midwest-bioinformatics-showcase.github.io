abstract: "The abscopal effect, where local radiotherapy (RT) induces regression of distant tumors, reveals the immune system's latent capacity for systemic tumor control. Although RT reliably triggers antigen release and type-I interferon (IFN-I) signaling that licenses dendritic cells (DCs) to activate CD8⁺ T cells, these priming events seldom propagate beyond the irradiated site. This failure highlights a regulatory bottleneck within the tumor-draining lymph node (tdLN), where local activation must be converted into systemic immunity. Here, we develop a spatiotemporal agent-based model (ABM) that formalizes the tdLN as an immune control architecture rather than a passive priming site. The model incorporates DC licensing, CD8⁺ T-cell scanning and differentiation, checkpoint saturation, and fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)–guided topology that shapes DC–T-cell encounter probabilities. This integrated framework reproduces four mechanistic gates underlying abscopal failure: (i) threshold-dependent amplification of early immune cues, (ii) temporal synchronization among DC influx, antigen persistence, and T-cell availability, (iii) topology-driven spatial biasing of interactions by the FRC scaffold, and (iv) density-induced checkpoint dominance that suppresses otherwise antigen-rich contexts. Systemic amplification emerges only when DC licensing, antigen durability, and IFN-I timing align with FRC-guided topology to sustain productive DC–T-cell encounters. Simulations further reveal how immunotherapies such as STING agonism, DC maturation signals, and checkpoint blockade each engage distinct control gates within the tdLN, reshaping immune trajectories through non-overlapping mechanisms. Together, this work defines the control logic governing tdLN-mediated immune propagation and demonstrates how coordinated modulation of topology, timing, and feedback can transform rare abscopal responses into reproducible systemic immunity."

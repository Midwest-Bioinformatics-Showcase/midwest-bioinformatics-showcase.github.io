# Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminar Series

The **Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminars** highlight graduate students and postdoctoral researchers using high-performance computing (HPC) resources for genomics research.  

By providing a platform for students and postdocs to present their work to a community of peers and colleagues both from their home universities and across the Midwest, this weekly series fosters cross-institutional dialogue, provides professional development opportunities, and showcases cutting-edge genomics work enabled by HPC.

The **Spring 2026 series** is a collaborative effort between **Purdue University** and **Northwestern University**. Abstract submissions are now closed, and speakers will be announced soon.

# Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminar Series

The **Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminars** highlight graduate students and postdoctoral researchers using high-performance computing (HPC) resources for genomics research.  

By providing a platform for students and postdocs to present their work to a community of peers and colleagues both from their home universities and across the Midwest, this weekly series fosters cross-institutional dialogue, provides professional development opportunities, and showcases cutting-edge genomics work enabled by HPC.

The **Spring 2026 series** is a collaborative effort between **Purdue University** and **Northwestern University**, and students and postdoctoral researchers from those universities are invited to [submit an abstract](submit.html) to be considered as seminar speakers.

_But you don’t have to be affiliated with Purdue or Northwestern to attend!_  
Anyone interested in bioinformatics, computational genomics, or life sciences research is welcome to attend our virtual seminars. **Please fill out [this form](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/MtLwnQnUUT) to be added to our email list so you never miss a seminar.**

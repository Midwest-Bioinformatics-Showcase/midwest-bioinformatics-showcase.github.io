# Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminar Series

The **Midwest Bioinformatics Showcase Seminars** highlight graduate students and postdoctoral researchers using high-performance computing (HPC) resources for genomics research.  

By providing a platform for students and postdocs to present their work to a community of peers and colleagues both from their home universities and across the Midwest, this weekly series fosters cross-institutional dialogue, provides professional development opportunities, and showcases cutting-edge genomics work enabled by HPC.

The **2026 series** is a collaborative effort between **Purdue University** and **Northwestern University**, and students and postdoctoral researchers from those universities are invited to [submit an abstract](submit.html) to be considered as seminar speakers.

But you don’t have to be affiliated with Purdue or Northwestern to attend!  
Anyone interested in bioinformatics, computational genomics, or life sciences research is welcome to attend our virtual seminars.
